A common heuristic for coming up with couple names is combining the first syllable of one person's name with the LAST syllable of the other person's name.

These are BORING couple names, because the output is the same as one of the names of the people in the couple. In these cases, you would want to combine the first syllable from `Aaron` with the first syllable from `Sharon`, thus yielding `AaSha`, a much better couple name.
